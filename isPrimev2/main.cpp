/* is prime v2 
requires a folow loop 
while caluclating primes eliminates them as it goes along 

follow function 
i.e [clc1] 1 2 3 5 7 9 11 13 etc
[clc2] eliminate 11 so check divisiors as it goes along 
remove the primes/zeros no longer needed 7 * 3 21 
remove 7 and 3 from your check 
a follow function removes the values already listed in the table  add 7 and 3 to divisors 
once a prime is calculated it is added to the list of divisors 11
